# How to get started with ML

This my recommended study guide to get started with Machine Learning.

Watch the video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/wtolixa9XTg).

## 1. Math

Learn some math basics! Focus only on these topics, then come back later in case you need to learn more.

 * [Khan Academy - Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
 * [Khan Academy - Differential Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)
 * [Khan Academy - Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
 * [Khan Academy - Statistics Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
 * [Optional: 3Blue1Brown - Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/essence-of-linear-algebra-page/)
 
## 2. Learn Python

* [4h Beginner Course](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw)
* [6h Intermediate Python Programming Course](https://youtu.be/HGOBQPFzWKo)

## 3. Learn The ML Tech Stack:

* NumPy:  [1h NumPy Crash Course](https://youtu.be/9JUAPgtkKpI)
* Pandas: [1h Pandas Crash Course](https://youtu.be/vmEHCJofslg)
* Matplotlib: [1h Matplotlib Crash Course Course](https://youtu.be/3Xc3CA655Y4)

(Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow are taught in step 4. PyTorch is optional, maybe in step 7)

## 4. Machine Learning Courses

* [Machine Learning Specialization Andrew Ng | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) (3 Courses)
* Optional: [Machine Learning From Scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2Upcrywf-u2etjdxxkL8nl7E)

## 5. Hands-on Data Preparation

* [Kaggle Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
* [Kaggle Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)

## 6. Practice!

Solve Challenges and build your own projects with datasets from [Kaggle.com](Kaggle.com).

## 7. Specialize & Create Blog

* Specialize in one field (e.g. Computer Vision, NLP, etc.) 
* Look at requirements in corresponding job descriptions and learn those skills
* Tip: Create a blog and share tutorials and what you have learned!

## Books
If you prefer learning with books, these are great recommendations:

* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
* [Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn](https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-with-pytorch-and-scikit-learn/9781801819312)
